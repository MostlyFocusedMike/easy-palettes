# easy-palettes
Make, save, and access multiple palettes quickly and easily with [easy-palettes](https://mostlyfocusedmike.github.io/easy-palettes/)


With this site, you can experiment, create, and save dozens of palettes without the hassle of logging in. You can also copy the codes (with or without the hash mark) directly to your clipboard with the click of a button. Over 50 palettes come preloaded for you to look through, get inspired, and implement in no time at all. You can also easily resize your browser so it fits next to your IDE or layout editor and all your colors and palettes will still be easily accessible at first glance.

So why not use [easy-palettes](https://mostlyfocusedmike.github.io/easy-palettes/) and simplify your next design project? 

### PROJECT GOALS
-Build an app using jQuery

-Build an app using a plugin (in this case JSColor)

-Save 5 colors per palette

-Preload and save multiple palettes 

-Apparently take forever to finish it

### PROJECT NOTES
This took me a while to finish becuase I just sort of had to figure out a reason for it existing, there are so many palette makers out there. However, while some are good for creating palettes...actually putting them into your workflow is a pain. Some sites suggested palettes with no codes, so you'd have to take a snapshot and then use an eyedropper. Dumb. So, easy-palettes is designed with workflow in mind. It prioritizes both storing colors and accessing them quickly and efficiently. I wanted to be sure that you could resize the site to as thin as possible next to photoshop, but you'd still be able to see and work with everything.

Tech-wise, I think jQuery was absolutely not needed but good for practice. It did make the code much shorter, but ultimately if speed ever became a problem, writing this site in vanilla js wouldn't really be much different. Working with the JSColor plugin was super simple as well. If you're looking for a color picker plugin, this one is small, light, and gets the job done in regular js. 

Overall, I like how this project turned out and I think it looks neat.
